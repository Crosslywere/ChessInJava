### Font Rendering Tutorial

- [Site](https://dev.to/shreyaspranav/how-to-render-truetype-fonts-in-opengl-using-stbtruetypeh-1p5k) & [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shreyaspranav/stb-truetype-example)

# How to use

You can run the TestingApplication class located [here](src/test/java/com/crossly/TestingApplication.java)

It simply renders a textured square which can be clicked on to play a sound.

It also implements a fly camera ie `W`,`A`,`S`,`D` to move & hold the `Right Mouse Button` to rotate the camera.

Run the Chess class located [here](src/main/java/com/crossly/chess/Chess.java)

It doesn't do much currently. Other than render some pawn and changes their color when they are selected(clicked on).
